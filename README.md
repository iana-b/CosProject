This is a personal web app where I collect and review cosmetics I have used.
The app allows me to:
- Keep track of skincare, makeup, and haircare products I've tried
- Assign ratings to each product
- Write reviews and personal notes
- Organize products by type and brand
The project is designed as a catalog for personal use, where I can monitor my experience with different products over time.
